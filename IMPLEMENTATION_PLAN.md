# Braintrust Nexus Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Building a workflow automation platform with two separate applications:
- **Admin App**: For Braintrust staff to manage users, clients, workflows, and billing
- **Client App**: For end-users to view dashboards, ROI metrics, and manage credentials

## Architecture Decision
**Monorepo Structure** using Turborepo with two separate Next.js applications sharing common packages.

### Repository Structure
```

├── apps/
│   ├── admin/          # Admin Next.js app
│   └── client/         # Client Next.js app

│   ├── database/      # Prisma schema & utilities
│   ├── auth/          # Authentication logic
│   └── types/         # Shared TypeScript types
├── turbo.json         # Turborepo configuration
└── package.json       # Root package.json
```

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15+ with App Router
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time capabilities)
- **ORM**: Prisma for type-safe database access
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **API**: TRPC for type-safe endpoints
- **UI**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **Build System**: Turborepo for monorepo management
- **Deployment**: Separate Vercel deployments for each app

## User Roles & Access Control
- **Admin**: Full access to admin app, no client app access
- **SE (Sales Engineer)**: Limited admin access, no client app access  
- **Client**: Access to client app only, no admin access

## Implementation Phases (3-Day Timeline)

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Day 1 Morning)
1. Configure Turborepo monorepo structure
2. Set up two Next.js applications (admin & client)
3. Configure shared packages (ui, database, auth, types)
4. Set up Prisma with Supabase integration
5. Configure authentication system with role-based access

### Phase 2: Database Schema & Core Features (Day 1 Afternoon - Day 2)
1. Design and implement Prisma schema for:
   - Users (admins, sales engineers, clients)
   - Companies (client organizations)
   - Workflows (automation processes)
   - Executions (workflow runs with mock data)
   - Billing & usage tracking
   - Credentials management
2. Implement Row Level Security policies
3. Create realistic seed data
4. Build core authentication flows

### Phase 3: Admin Application (Day 2 - Day 3 Morning)
1. **Dashboard**: Overview metrics and recent activity
2. **User Manager**: CRUD operations for all user types
3. **Client Manager**: Company management with user assignments
4. **Workflow Manager**: View and manage automation workflows
5. **Billing**: Usage tracking and payment management (mocked)

### Phase 4: Client Application (Day 3 Morning - Afternoon)
1. **Dashboard**: ROI metrics and key performance indicators
2. **Reporting**: Detailed analytics and export capabilities
3. **Credential Manager**: Secure credential storage interface
4. **Real-time Notifications**: Live updates on workflow status

### Phase 5: Polish & Testing (Day 3 Afternoon)
1. Implement critical test suites
2. UI/UX refinements to match Figma designs exactly
3. Performance optimization
4. Final integration testing

## Key Features to Implement

### Admin App Features
- **User Management**: Create, edit, deactivate users with role assignments
- **Client Management**: Onboard companies, assign workflows, track usage
- **Workflow Oversight**: Monitor all client workflows and performance
- **Billing Dashboard**: Track usage metrics and payment status (mocked)
- **System Administration**: Platform settings and configurations

### Client App Features
- **ROI Dashboard**: Visual metrics showing automation value
- **Workflow Status**: Real-time updates on running processes
- **Reporting Suite**: Detailed analytics with export options
- **Credential Management**: Secure storage for API keys and tokens
- **Notification Center**: Real-time alerts and updates

## Database Schema Highlights

### Core Tables
- `users` - All platform users with role-based access
- `companies` - Client organizations
- `workflows` - Automation process definitions
- `workflow_executions` - Historical run data (mocked)
- `credentials` - Encrypted credential storage
- `billing_usage` - Usage tracking for billing
- `notifications` - Real-time notification system

### Security Implementation
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
- Role-based access control at database level
- Encrypted credential storage
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

## Shared Component Strategy
Approximately 70-80% code reuse between applications through shared packages:

### Shared Components (`packages/ui/`)
- Form components (inputs, selectors, validation)
- Data display (tables, cards, metrics)
- Navigation elements (sidebars, headers)
- Modal dialogs and overlays
- Chart and visualization components

### App-Specific Components
- **Admin**: User management forms, billing interfaces
- **Client**: ROI dashboards, credential management

## Development Standards
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, no `any` types
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier for consistent formatting
- **Testing**: Critical path testing with Jest/Vitest
- **UI Consistency**: Match Figma designs pixel-perfect
- **Performance**: Optimize for fast loading and real-time updates

## Mock Data Strategy
- Realistic company names and user profiles
- Simulated workflow execution data with varying success rates
- Historical usage metrics for ROI calculations
- Mock billing data with different pricing tiers
- Sample credentials (safely mocked, no real API keys)

## Real-time Features
- Live workflow status updates via Supabase Realtime
- Instant notifications for important events
- Real-time dashboard metrics updates
- Live user activity indicators

## Deployment Strategy
- **Admin App**: `admin.nexus-demo.vercel.app`
- **Client App**: `app.nexus-demo.vercel.app`
- **Shared Database**: Single Supabase instance with RLS
- **Environment Separation**: Proper staging/production configs

## Success Metrics
- Pixel-perfect UI matching Figma designs
- Sub-200ms page load times
- 100% TypeScript coverage (no `any`)
- Critical user journeys fully tested
- Real-time features working smoothly
- Proper role-based access enforcement
